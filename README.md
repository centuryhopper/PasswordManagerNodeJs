# PasswordManagerNodeJs

## This is not the best way to implement a password manager. I created this because
### 1. I want to review and improve on my skills using node js and typescript
### 2. I want to be able to find a secure place to retrieve my passwords in case I forget one

## I do believe one-way hashing of passwords is more secure but I am doing two-way because of reason 2 above.


## These commands should be used in a bash terminal
### to install typescript globally, type ```sudo npm i -g typescript```

### to compile your typescript file into javascript, type ```tsc [your_file_name].ts```

### to create a typescript config file, type ```tsc --init```


### to set up a node project with, type ```npm init``` or shortcut the fill-in-the-blanks with ```npm init -y```

### to install dependencies (packages required for production), type ```npm i [name_of_package]```
### to install dev dependencies (packages not required for production), type ```npm i -D [name_of_package]```
